# Project Plan

## Current Stage

The project is past the initial MVP foundation. The app now has a Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, Supabase-backed PostgreSQL database, Supabase Auth, Gmail OAuth, Gmail import, AI triage with Gemini, reply approvals, Gmail draft creation, dashboard views, role-aware navigation, and local development servers.

Incremental Gmail history sync and recovery is now implemented locally. The next major product improvement is M3: automatic triage pipeline, which will triage newly created tickets without manual action.

- Added pages for overview, inbox, approvals, customers, analytics, integrations, workspace, team, and settings.
- Added responsive layout direction.
- Added reusable product UI components for badges, cards, queue rows, and app navigation.

## Next Recommended Milestone: M3 Automatic Triage Pipeline

### Goal

Newly created tickets should automatically receive AI triage, while duplicate imports and retry attempts remain idempotent and visible.

### Recommended Production Design

- Queue triage after the ticket transaction commits.
- Track one active triage job per ticket and prompt/schema version.
- Preserve manual retry for failed triage.
- Store AI result versions so prompt changes are auditable.
- Keep newly imported tickets visible even if triage is delayed or fails.

### Backend Work

- Add automatic triage enqueue after ticket creation.
- Add idempotent triage job state.
- Add retry behavior for transient AI failures.
- Add manual retry endpoint for owners/admins or permitted agents.

### Database Work

Add or extend triage tracking fields:

- ticket triage status
- active triage job identifier
- prompt/schema version
- last triage error
- retry metadata

### Frontend Work

- Show triage pending, failed, and retryable states.
- Keep existing ticket detail AI sections stable while jobs run.
- Make manual retry available where the user has permission.

## Later Milestones

### Knowledge and Automation

- Add reusable response templates.
- Add company policy or knowledge base snippets.
- Allow AI replies to use workspace knowledge.
- Add routing or assignment rules.

### Analytics

- Response time trends.
- Triage volume by urgency.
- AI confidence distribution.
- Draft approval rate.
- Agent workload.

### Production Readiness

- Rotate all exposed development secrets.
- Confirm staging and production environment variables.
- Confirm deployed Google OAuth redirect URLs.
- Confirm deployed CORS origins.
- Confirm Render worker and Redis are running.
- Run full end-to-end staging test.
